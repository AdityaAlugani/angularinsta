**Individual Performance Goals:**  
This fiscal year, Iâ€™ve focused on strengthening my grasp of **high-level design (HLD)** concepts like scalability strategies (horizontal/vertical scaling, sharding), fault tolerance (redundancy, circuit breakers), and distributed system principles (CAP theorem, consistency models). Iâ€™ve also deepened my understanding of **low-level design (LLD)**, including schema optimization (indexing, normalization), code modularity (SOLID principles, design patterns), and Spring Boot best practices (dependency injection, RESTful APIs, JPA/Hibernate). By bridging these areas, I aim to contribute to systems that are both resilient at scale and maintainable at the code level, reducing technical debt and improving team efficiency.  

**Development Goals & Support Needed:**  
Moving forward, Iâ€™d like to refine my ability to balance trade-offs in HLD (e.g., availability vs. consistency) and enhance LLD precision (e.g., advanced query tuning, reactive programming with Spring Boot). To achieve this, mentorship on real-world architectural challenges and exposure to cloud-native tools (e.g., Kubernetes, distributed tracing) would be invaluable. Iâ€™m also keen to collaborate on cross-team initiatives to align my technical growth with broader organizational goalsâ€”whether optimizing existing systems or contributing to scalable new solutions. Letâ€™s discuss how I can best support our roadmap!

This version balances clarity with approachability, avoids jargon-heavy lists, and keeps the focus on your *understanding* of concepts rather than project specifics. Let me know if youâ€™d like further tweaks! ðŸ˜Š






# SNS

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
